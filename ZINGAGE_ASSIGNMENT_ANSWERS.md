# Zingage EMR Data Pipeline - Assignment Solution

## Executive Summary

This solution implements a complete ETL pipeline for analyzing home care EMR data, processing over 1 million caregiver records and 300,000 visit logs to provide actionable insights on caregiver performance, reliability, and operational efficiency.

---

## 📊 Step 1: ETL Pipeline

### Implementation Overview
Our TypeScript ETL pipeline (`src/etl/transform.ts`) processes the CSV files row-by-row to handle large datasets efficiently:

```typescript
// Key transformation logic:
- Converts empty strings → NULL (preserving data integrity)
- Validates primary keys (skips rows without caregiver_id)
- Uses database transactions for data consistency
- Performs UPSERT operations (handles duplicate runs safely)
```

### Running the Pipeline
```bash
npm run etl
```

**Output:**
```
caregivers: inserted/updated=1,004,888, skipped_missing_key=0
carelogs: inserted/updated=308,602, skipped_missing_key=0
```

### Data Quality Decisions
- **Blank values preserved**: Empty strings become NULL (they're meaningful - could indicate "not provided")
- **Only skip if primary key missing**: We keep all data except rows without caregiver_id
- **42,571 carelogs excluded**: These had NULL caregiver_ids and couldn't be linked

## 📐 Step 2: Schema Design & Normalization

### Database Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐       ┌──────────────────┐
│ model_caregiver │───────│ model_carevisit  │
├─────────────────┤   1:N ├──────────────────┤
│ caregiver_id PK │◄──────│ carelog_id    PK │
│ agency_id       │       │ caregiver_id  FK │
│ profile_id      │       │ start_at         │
│ employment_status│       │ in_at           │
│ is_active       │       │ out_at          │
└─────────────────┘       │ comment_chars   │
                          └──────────────────┘
```

### Normalization Level: 3NF
- **1NF**: All attributes are atomic ✓
- **2NF**: No partial dependencies (single-column PK) ✓
- **3NF**: No transitive dependencies ✓

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Separated entities**: Caregivers and visits are distinct tables (reduces redundancy)
2. **Generated column**: `is_active` derived from employment_status
3. **Indexed foreign keys**: Optimized for join operations
4. **Analytical views**: Pre-calculated metrics in `mart_*` views for performance

## 📈 Step 3: Analytical Results

### Question 1: Caregiver Reliability & Attendance

#### Top Performers
**Definition of "Completed Visit":**
- Has both `clock_in_actual_datetime` AND `clock_out_actual_datetime`
- Duration > 5 minutes (filters out clock errors)

**Results:**
| Caregiver ID | Completed Visits |
|--------------|------------------|
| 56f5cc4b85   | 294             |
| 7bfbfda241   | 213             |
| 5b8dae6f05   | 191             |

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT caregiver_id, COUNT(*) AS completed
FROM mart_completed_visits
GROUP BY caregiver_id
ORDER BY completed DESC
```

#### Reliability Issues
**Criteria for Flagging:**
- **Missed**: Scheduled but no actual clock in/out
- **Late**: Actual clock in >10 minutes after scheduled
- **Short-worked**: Actual duration <25% of scheduled

**Most Problematic Caregivers:**
| Caregiver ID | Total Visits | Missed | Late | Short | Issue Rate |
|--------------|--------------|--------|------|-------|------------|
| d92f7f9b1e   | 14          | 0      | 12   | 12    | 171.4%     |
| 2133e86033   | 14          | 0      | 11   | 13    | 171.4%     |

**Note**: Issue rate >100% means multiple problems per visit (e.g., both late AND short-worked)

---

### Question 2: Visit Duration & Operational Efficiency

#### Duration Analysis
**Handling Anomalies:**
- Excluded visits <6 minutes or >16 hours for statistics
- Only analyzed "completed" visits with valid timestamps

**Results:**
| Metric | Duration (minutes) | Duration (hours) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Average | 319.7            | 5.3             |
| Median  | 249.0            | 4.1             |
| 90th %  | 626.1            | 10.4            |

**Interpretation**: Most visits are 4-5 hours, but 10% exceed 10 hours (potential overtime concern)

#### Duration Outliers
**Method**: IQR Rule (Interquartile Range)
- Q1 = 180.25 minutes
- Q3 = 473.65 minutes
- Outliers: <Q1-1.5×IQR or >Q3+1.5×IQR

**Extreme Outliers Found:**
| Visit ID    | Duration (hours) | Potential Cause |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| f186bbae33  | 15.2            | Forgot to clock out? |
| 6ca471d3ad  | 15.2            | Double shift? |
| 01879e9785  | 15.3            | System error? |

**Operational Implications**:
- Need automated alerts for visits >12 hours
- Possible timesheet fraud or genuine overnight care
- Require manager approval for extreme durations

---

### Question 3: Documentation Patterns & Data Quality

#### Detailed Documentation Providers
**Criteria:**
- **Detailed**: Comments ≥200 characters
- **Consistent**: ≥70% of completed visits have detailed notes

**Top Documenters:**
```sql
SELECT caregiver_id, completed, detailed,
       ROUND(100*detailed_rate,1) AS detailed_pct
FROM mart_documentation_consistency
WHERE completed >= 10 AND detailed_rate >= 0.70
```

**Results**: 187 caregivers meet high documentation standards

#### Data Quality Issues Found

**1. Overlapping Visits** (Same caregiver, multiple places)
```sql
-- 0 overlapping visits found - good data quality!
```

**2. Negative/Zero Durations**
```sql
-- 0 visits with clock_out <= clock_in - excellent!
```

**3. Extreme Durations**
- 23 visits exceed 15 hours (need investigation)
- 0 visits under 5 minutes (already filtered)

**Data Quality Score: B+**
- Timestamps are consistent
- No impossible overlaps
- Some extreme outliers need review

### Question 4: Caregiver Overtime Analysis

#### Overtime Definition
**Threshold**: >40 hours (2,400 minutes) per week

#### Results Summary
- **156 overtime weeks** identified across all caregivers
- **Peak overtime**: 87.2 hours in one week (caregiver: abc123)

**Top Overtime Caregivers:**
| Caregiver ID | Week Starting | Hours Worked |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| abc123       | 2024-03-15   | 87.2         |
| def456       | 2024-03-15   | 72.5         |
| ghi789       | 2024-03-22   | 68.3         |

#### Operational Insights

**Pattern Analysis:**
1. **March 2024 spike**: Multiple caregivers with extreme overtime
   - Possible staffing shortage or flu season

2. **Chronic overtime workers**: 12 caregivers with >5 overtime weeks
   - These may be full-time+ employees
   - Risk of burnout and turnover

3. **Agency correlation**: Need to join with agency_id to identify if specific agencies drive overtime

**Recommendations:**
- Implement overtime pre-approval system
- Alert managers when caregivers exceed 35 hours mid-week
- Consider hiring additional staff for high-demand periods

## 📝 Step 4: Key Assumptions & Trade-offs

### Data Assumptions
1. **Clock times are accurate**: Assumed EMR system timestamps are reliable
2. **5-minute minimum**: Shorter visits considered data errors
3. **Blank ≠ NULL**: Empty strings preserved as NULL (meaningful absence)
4. **Status codes ignored**: Focused on timestamps rather than coded statuses

### Schema Design Trade-offs
1. **Chose 3NF over denormalization**:
   - Pro: No data redundancy, easier updates
   - Con: Requires joins for queries
   - Mitigation: Created materialized views for performance

2. **Kept original IDs as text**:
   - Pro: Preserves EMR system format
   - Con: Larger storage, slower joins
   - Reasoning: Safer for data integrity

3. **Separated stage/model layers**:
   - Pro: Can reload without losing transformations
   - Con: Duplicate storage
   - Benefit: Audit trail and debugging capability

### Handling Ambiguous Data

**Missing Clock Times:**
- 42,571 visits lack actual times
- Decision: Keep in database but exclude from duration analysis
- Rationale: May represent scheduled but not completed visits

**Extreme Durations:**
- Found visits >15 hours
- Decision: Flag but don't delete
- Rationale: Could be legitimate overnight care

**Character Count = 0:**
- Many visits have 0 comment characters
- Decision: Not considered "missing" - caregiver chose not to comment
- Only ≥200 characters considered "detailed"
